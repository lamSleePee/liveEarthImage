# Live Earth Image Viewer

A real-time satellite imagery viewer that displays live Earth images from multiple satellite sources. View and download stitched full-disk satellite imagery from Himawari, GK2A, and Meteosat-9 satellites.

## Features

- 🌍 **Live Satellite Imagery**: Automatically uses the most recent available satellite images (updated every 10 minutes)
- 🛰️ **Multiple Satellite Sources**:
  - Himawari (16×16 grid)
  - GK2A CIRA Geodebra (16×16 grid)
  - GK2A Geocolor (16×16 grid)
  - Meteosat-9 (8×8 grid)
- 📥 **Download Stitched Images**: Combine all tiles into a single high-resolution image
- 🎨 **Dark Theme**: Beautiful black background optimized for viewing space imagery
- ⚡ **Real-time Updates**: Refresh button to get the latest available images

## How It Works

The viewer loads satellite imagery tiles from the CIRA Slider service. Images are automatically selected based on the current UTC time, rounded down to the nearest 10-minute interval. Each satellite provides tiles in a grid format that are stitched together to create a full-disk view of Earth.

## Usage

1. Select a satellite source from the top navigation
2. Click "🔄 Refresh Time" to update to the latest available time
3. Click "Load All Tiles" to load all image tiles
4. Once loaded, click "Stitch & Download" to combine tiles and download the full image
